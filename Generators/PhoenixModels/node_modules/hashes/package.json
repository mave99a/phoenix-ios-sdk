Please refer to the [WiKi article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) for more information.\r\nIn this implementation each of the two aforementioned functions is calculated in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. The function that was provided in the options.\r\n2. The function on the key object.\r\n3. A default function from the _statics_ object.\r\n\r\nA HashSet is similar to the HashTable but it stores only the keys. The data should be stored within the key. All the rules of the HashTable apply to the HashSet.\r\n\r\n##API\r\n\r\nTo use the module in your code simply type\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar hashes = require('hashes');\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Options\r\nYou may provide an optional argument to the constructors called _options_. The options object can have any of the following methods and properties:\r\n\r\n* **getHashCode(key)** - Returns the hash code of the given _key_ object.\r\n\r\n* **equal(first, second)** - Returns true if the given arguments are equal, and false otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe options object is used throughout the different API calls. By default, providing any of these functions will override \r\nthe default functions and the key specific functions by that name.\r\n\r\n###HashTable\r\nTo create a new HashTable use the _new_ keyword:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myHashTable = new hashes.HashTable();\r\n``` \r\n\r\n* **HashTable([options])** - Creates a new instance of the HashTable object. An optional _options_ argument can be provided (see above).\r\n\r\n* **add(key, value, [overwriteIfExists])** - Adds the given key-value pair to the HashTable. _overwriteIfExists_ is an optional argument that is used when the given key already exists in the HashTable.\r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is truthy then the given key-value pair will overwrite the existing key-value pair, otherwise the given key-value pair will not be added to the HashTable. Returns true if the HashTable was modified and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n* **addRange(keys, values, [overwriteIfExists])** - Adds the given keys and values as key-value pairs to the HashTable. If the length of the two arguments is different, the minimum length is used. \r\n_overwriteIfExists_ is an optional argument that is used when the given key already exists in the HashTable.\r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is truthy then the given key-value pair will overwrite the existing key-value pair, otherwise the given key-value pair will not be added to the HashTable. \r\nReturns the number of key-value pairs that were added to the HashTable.\r\n\r\n* **addRange(keyValuePairs, [overwriteIfExists])** - Adds the given key-value pairs to the HashTable (each object in the given collection must contain a _key_ and a _value_ property). \r\n_overwriteIfExists_ is an optional argument that is used when the given key already exists in the HashTable.\r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is truthy then the given key-value pair will overwrite the existing key-value pair, otherwise the given key-value pair will not be added to the HashTable. \r\nReturns the number of key-value pairs that were added to the HashTable.\r\n\r\n* **get(key)** - Returns the key-value pair associated with the given key. If there is no key-value pair associated with the given key, null is returned. The returned object is ```{key:key, value:value}```.\r\n(Note that a pair is returned because the key in the HashTable may differ from the provided key.)\r\n\r\n* **remove(key)** - Removes the key-value pair associated with the given key from the HashTable. Returns true if a key-value pair was removed and false otherwise (e.g. when there is no value associated with the given key).\r\n\r\n* **contains(key)** - Returns true if there is a value associated with the given key and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n* **getHashes()** - Returns a string array of all the hashes that are currently in the HashTable.\r\n\r\n* **getKeyValuePairs()** - Returns an array of all the key-value pairs in the HashTable **in no particular order**. Each object in the returned array is ```{key:key, value:value}```.\r\n\r\n* **count()** - Returns the number of key-value pairs in the HashTable.\r\n\r\n* **clear()** - Removes all the key-value pairs from the HashTable.\r\n\r\n* **clone()** - Returns a copy of the HashTable. All user elements are copied by reference.\r\n\r\n* **rehash(options, overwriteIfExists)** - Returns a copy of the HashTable but all the key-value pairs are re-insrted using the new options. _overwriteIfExists_ is handled the same way as in the _add_ function.\r\n\r\n#### Static Functions\r\n\r\n* **[static] union(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashTable which is a union of the first and second HashTables. \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashTable and all the key-value pairs are added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashTable already exists in the first HashTable the entire key-value pair is overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key-value pair from the second HashTable is ignored. In any case the key-value pairs from the first HashTable are in the result.\r\n\r\n* **[static] intersection(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashTable which is an intersection of the first and second HashTables. \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashTable and all the key-value pairs are added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashTable already exists in the first HashTable the entire key-value pair is overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key-value pair from the second HashTable is ignored. In any case the key-value pairs from the first HashTable are in the result.\r\n\r\n* **[static] difference(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashTable which is the difference of the first and second HashTables (i.e. all the key-value pairs which are in the first HashTable but not in the second HashTable). \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashTable and all the key-value pairs are added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashTable already exists in the first HashTable the entire key-value pair is overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key-value pair from the second HashTable is ignored.    \r\n\r\n* **[static] symmetricDifference(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashTable which is the symmetric difference of the first and second HashTables (i.e. all the key-value pairs which are in the first HashTable but not in the second HashTable \r\nor in the second HashTable but not in the first). \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashTable and all the key-value pairs are added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashTable already exists in the first HashTable the entire key-value pair is overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key-value pair from the second HashTable is ignored. \r\n\r\n\r\n###HashSet\r\nTo create a new HashSet use the _new_ keyword:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myHashSet = new hashes.HashSet();\r\n``` \r\n\r\n* **HashSet([options])** - Creates a new instance of the HashSet object. An optional _options_ argument can be provided (see above).\r\n\r\n* **add(key, [overwriteIfExists])** - Adds the given key to the HashSet. _overwriteIfExists_ is an optional argument that is used when the given key already exists in the HashSet.\r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is truthy then the given key will overwrite the existing key, otherwise the given key is ignored.\r\n\r\n* **addRange(keys, [overwriteIfExists])** - Adds the given keys to the HashSet. \r\n_overwriteIfExists_ is an optional argument that is used when the given key already exists in the HashSet.\r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is truthy then the given key will overwrite the existing key, otherwise the given key pair will not be added to the HashSet. \r\nReturns the number of keys that were added to the HashSet.\r\n\r\n* **get(key)** - Returns the key in the HashSet which is equal to the given key. If there is no key equal to the given key, null is returned.\r\n\r\n* **remove(key)** - Removes the key from the HashSet. Returns true if a key was removed and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n* **contains(key)** - Returns true if the given key is in the HashSet and false otherwise.\r\n\r\n* **getHashes()** - Returns a string array of all the hashes that are currently in the HashSet.\r\n\r\n* **getKeys()** - Returns an array of all the keys in the HashSet **in no particular order**.\r\n\r\n* **count()** - Returns the number of keys the HashSet.\r\n\r\n* **clear()** - Removes all the keys from the HashSet.\r\n\r\n* **clone()** - Returns a copy of the HashSet. All user elements are copied by reference.\r\n\r\n* **rehash(options, overwriteIfExists)** - Returns a copy of the HashSet but all the keys  are re-insrted using the new options. _overwriteIfExists_ is handled the same way as in the _add_ function.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Static Functions\r\n\r\n* **[static] union(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashSet which is a union of the first and second HashSets. \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashSet and all the keys added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashSet already exists in the first HashTable it will be overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key is ignored.\r\n\r\n* **[static] intersection(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashSet which is an intersection of the first and second HashSets. \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter. The options are used to create the result HashSet and all the keys are added accordingly.\r\nWhen _overwriteIfExists_ is true and a key from the second HashSet already exists in the first HashSet the key is overwritten in the result. \r\nIf _overwriteIfExists_ is false then the key from the second HashSet is ignored. In any case the keys from the first HashSet are in the result.\r\n\r\n* **[static] difference(first, second, [options], [overwriteIfExists])** - Creates a new HashSet which is the difference of the first and second HashSets (i.e. all the keys which are in the first HashSet but not in the second HashSet). \r\nYou may specify an optional _options_ parameter and an optional _overwriteIfExists_ parameter.
